file distribution how can we down load a file from
pure p2p architecture 
no always on server 
arbitrary end systems directly communicate 
peer are intermittently connected and change ip address 

i.e. D ꜀₋ₛ = max {n x F / Uₛ , F/Dₘᵢₙ} - for client server

Distribution time for client-server 
(D ꜀₋ₛ) ≥ max {n × F / Uₛ, F/Dₘᵢₙ}sec.
This means max 
{n × F / Uₛ, F/Dₘᵢₙ} 
will give the lower bound.
Distribution time(Dₚ₂ₚ) ≥ max {F/ Uₛ, F/Dₘᵢₙ, n × F / Uₜₒₜₐₗ}.
Dₚ₂ₚ = max {F/ Uₛ, F/Dₘᵢₙ, n x F / Uₜₒₜₐₗ} - for peer to peer
