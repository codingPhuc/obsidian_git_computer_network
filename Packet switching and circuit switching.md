#sumarization  
Circuit switching and packet switching are the two different methods of switching that are used to connect multiple communicating devices with one another. The key difference between circuit switching and packet switching is that packet switching is connectionless, whereas circuit switching is connection-oriented.
## packet switching 
Packet switching is defined as the connectionless network where the messages are divided and grouped together and this is known as a packet. Each packet is routed from the source to the destination as individual packets. The actual data in these packets are carried by the payload. When the packet arrives at the destination, it is the responsibility of the destination to put these packets in the right order

### Advantages

-   There is no delay in the delivery of the packets as they are sent to the destination as soon as they are available.
-   There is no requirement for massive storage space as the information is passed on to the destination as soon as they are received.
-   Failure in the links does not stop the delivery of the data as these packets can be routed from other paths too.
-   Multiple users can use the same channel while transferring their packets.
-   The usage of bandwidth is better in case of packet switching as multiple sources can transfer packets from the same source link.

### Disadvantages

-   Installation costs of packet switching are expensive.
-   The delivery of these packets becomes easy when complicated protocols are used.
-   High-quality voice calls cannot use packet switching as there is a lot of delay in this type of communication.
-   Connectivity issues may lead to loss of information and delay in the delivery of the information.
## circuit Switching 
Circuit switching is defined as the method of switching which is used for establishing a dedicated [communication path](https://byjus.com/jee/communication-systems/) between the sender and the receiver. The link which is established between the sender and the receiver is in the physical form. An analog telephone network is a well-known example of circuit switching. [Bandwidth](https://byjus.com/physics/what-is-bandwidth-of-a-signal-how-is-bandwidth-measured/) is fixed in this type of switching.
## what is circuit Switching used for 
- continuous connections , long-distance calling on a landline 
- dial-up network connections , connectiong to the internet via dial-up 
- optical circuit switching , used to scale data centers and meet growing bandwidth requirement 
### Advantages 

-   The bandwidth used is fixed.
-   The quality of communication is increased as a dedicated communication channel is used.
-   The rate at which the data is transmitted is fixed.
-   While switching, no time is wasted in waiting.
-   It is preferred when communication is long and continuous.

### Disadvantages 

-   Since dedicated channels are used, the bandwidth required is more.
-   The utilization of resources is not full.
-   Since a dedicated channel has been used, the transmission of other data becomes impossible.
-   The time taken by the two stations for the establishment of the physical link is too long.
-   Circuit switching is expensive because every connection uses a dedicated path establishment.
-   The link between the sender and the receiver will be maintained until and unless the user terminates the link. This will also continue if there is no transfer of data taking place.
