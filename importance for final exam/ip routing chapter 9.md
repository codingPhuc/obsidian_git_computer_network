and enabled networked applications. It runs on most Cisco routers as well as a growing

Here’s a short list of some important things that the Cisco router IOS software is respon-

■ Carrying network protocols and functions
■ Connecting high-speed traffic between devices
■ Adding security to control access and stopping unauthorized network use
■ Providing scalability for ease of network growth and redundancy
■ Supplying network reliability for connecting to network resources
You can access the Cisco IOS through the console port of a router or switch, from a
modem into the auxiliary (or aux) port on a router, or even through Telnet and Secure Shell
(SSH). Access to the IOS command line is called an EXEC session .
