the thing that are containt  in the network edge 
host 
host : clienst and servers 
servers often in data centers 

## access networks  physical media  
### how to conect end system to edge router ? 

#### residential access net 
 frequency division multiplexing (FDM): different channels transmitted in different frequency hands 
 Hfc : hybird fiber coax : 
 - asymmetric : up to 40 Mbps - 1.2Gbs down stream transmission rate , 30-100Mps

digital  subscriber line (DSL)
	like cable network DSL line is  asymetric with 24 -25 Mbps dedicated downstream tranmission rate 
	and 3.5 -16 Mbps up stream

### wireless  local area net work (WLANS) 
- withen 100ft  or around 
- mbPS transmission rate 
### wide area cllulare access nework 
- provide by  mobile ,cellulare network operator  (10s km)
- 10 Mnps 
- 4G cellular networks 
### enterprise network 
- is the uprade of home network 
- have multiple switch and router 
#### data center network 
- huge bandwitch that connect a lot of deviced 

### host send packets of data 
host sending function : 
- take application message 
- breaks into smaller chunks ,known as packets , of lenght L bits 
- transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R 
	- link transmission rate , aka link capacity , aka link bandwidth 
	- packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L/R
