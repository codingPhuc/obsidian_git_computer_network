bit : propagetes between transmitter receiver pairs 

physical link : what lies between transmitter and receiver 
guided media : 
- signal : propagate in soil 
### coaxial cable 
- two cocentric copper conductore 
- bidirectional 
- broadband 
### fiber optic cable :
glass fiber carrying light pulses each pulse a bit 
- hige speed operation : 
	- hige-speed point to point tranmission 
- low error rate : 
	- repeater spaced far apart 
	- immine to electromag
