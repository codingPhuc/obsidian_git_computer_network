**Network Protocols**Â are a set of guidelines governing the exchange of information in a simple, dependable and secure way. Network protocols are formal standards and policies comprised of rules, methodology, and configurations that define communication between two or more devices over a network. To effectively send and receive information, devices on the two sides of a communication exchange must follow protocols.
