## concept of end systems 
- device connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network")sometimes referred to as an **end system** or **end station**, 
- because it sits at the edge of the network. The [end user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user "End user") directly interacts with an end system that provides information or services



## concept of end devices
End network devices, also known as end-user devices or endpoints, are devices that serve as the final point of communication in a network. These devices facilitate direct interaction with users and enable them to access, create, and exchange information over the network. Examples of end network devices include:

1. Personal computers (desktops, laptops)  
2. Smartphones and tablets  
3. Network printers and scanners  
4. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart home appliances, wearables, and sensors

5. Servers hosting websites or applications for end-user access  
6. Teleconferencing equipment  
7. Gaming consoles and media streaming devices

### host concept computer network 
in computer network a host refers to a computer that can interated with other host in a network , host can be servers responsible for [for transmitting and receiving data, services, and applications](https://linuxsimply.com/what-is-host-in-computer-network/)
host have their unique ip address on a TCP or IP network 
## network edge computer network 
- the network edge refer to an area where the devices or the local network interfaces with the internet . The edge is close to the devices it is communicating meaning that it is in the same network as the devices or network and is an entry point to the internet or a different network 
- network edge are crucial to security boundary that network administrators must provide solution for 

## network core 
mesh of interconnected router 
packet-switching : host break application layer messages into packets 
- network forwards packet from one router to the next , across links on path from source to destination 
### network core function 
- hige speed swirching and routing 
- gateway to other networks 
- reliability and fault tolerance 
### what is in the network core 
- cabling,
- routers,
- switches, 
- and hubs.
