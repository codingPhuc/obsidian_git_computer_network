## concept of end systems 
An end system is a device that facilitates Internet communications and can be used to access the Internet directly, such as personal computers and cameras, or indirectly, through servers for data like email and web pages. The interconnected network of end systems makes up the Internet architecture, allowing global information exchange via the Internet. However, end systems can be vulnerable to viruses, creating a weak point in security, which can be addressed through security measures such as data encoding, limited access and regular data backups.
